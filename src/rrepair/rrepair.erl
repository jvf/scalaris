%% @doc    replica repair module 
%%         Replica sets will be synchronized in two steps.
%%          I) reconciliation   - find set differences  (rr_recon.erl)
%%         II) resolution       - resolve found differences (rr_resolve.erl)
%%
%%         Examples:
%%            1) remote node should get a single kvv-pair (key,value,version)
